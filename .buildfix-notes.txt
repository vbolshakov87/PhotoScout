Build Fixes Applied
===================

Fixed TypeScript compilation errors:

1. Chat.tsx - Removed unused 'useState' import
2. Added vite-env.d.ts - Defined ImportMeta types for Vite environment variables
3. ConversationPage.tsx - Removed unused 'conversation' state variable

All packages now build successfully:
✅ packages/shared - TypeScript types compiled
✅ packages/api - Lambda handlers bundled (esbuild)
✅ packages/web - React app built (Vite)
✅ infra - CDK stack compiled

Build outputs verified:
- packages/api/dist/ contains 3 Lambda handlers
- packages/web/dist/ contains production build
- infra/lib/ contains compiled CDK stack

Project is ready for deployment!
